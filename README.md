# The Wild Restro - React Learning Project

## Project Overview

"The Wild Restro" is a restaurant application developed primarily for the purpose of learning React and related technologies. In this project, I had the opportunity to work with a variety of React libraries and technologies, including:

- **Styled Components:** Creating visually appealing and responsive user interfaces for the application.

- **React Query:** Efficiently managing data fetching and state management for a smoother user experience.

- **React Hook Forms:** Handling complex forms and user inputs using React's hooks.

- **React Router:** Implementing client-side routing and navigation for a seamless user experience.

- **Super Base:** Setting up a backend with a complete database from scratch using Super Base, enabling exploration of full-stack development concepts.

## Key Features

As I explored and experimented with "The Wild Restro" project, I encountered and implemented several key features, including:

- Browsing a list of restaurants.
- Viewing detailed restaurant information, including menus.
- Making reservations for specific dates and times.
- Leaving reviews and ratings for restaurants.
- Exploring user authentication and authorization.
- Building and managing a backend database with Super Base.
